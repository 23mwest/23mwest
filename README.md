# Mike West

I build production software.

Most of my experience sits between frontend architecture and backend systems — shipping user-facing applications while designing the infrastructure underneath them to hold up over time.

I care about:

- Clear abstraction boundaries
- Thoughtful state management
- Authentication and data flow done correctly
- Performance and reliability in real environments
- Code that stays maintainable after version 1

This profile isn’t a portfolio or a resume.
It’s a collection of projects that reflect how I think about systems.

Start with the pinned repositories.
